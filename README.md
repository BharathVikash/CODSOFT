An online internship on the domian Machine Learning completed during June 2024.

Task No.1:
Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

Task No.2:
Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscriptionbased service or business. Use historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn.

Task No.3:
Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.
